# colab-component
A React.js inspired Component for building a simple reactive UI in Google Colaboratory.

### Why?
Sometimes there is some manual work that has to be done with your data. Instead of building a custom desktop app, why not do so in Colab?

I built this component inspired by the react framework, which provides in my opinion the best tools for quick prototype-like development ideal for custom data exploring and data analysis tools.

### How?
The `google.colab` package offers an interface to run python functions in the `output`. Combine that with the fact that python notebooks can render full on HTML and you can build UIs using python, HTML, css and javascript!

## Install

In a cell run:

```bash
!pip3 install colab-component
```
